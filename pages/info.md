## Who I am and what I do...
I am a freelance scientist who has lived, studied, and worked in many cities across the United States and Europe. After moving to Germany, I decided to pursue work as an independent expert in research, research support, and academic editing and offer my highly diversified skill set to support scientists in areas where they need the most help. I enjoy helping people, solving problems, and learning what I need in order to get the job done.

## Why?
I am passionate about science, but having worn many different hats over the course of my scientific career, I wanted to find a job in which I could make use of all of my experiences in pure research and research support and operations. Most people are either in pure research or in the service sector, while I have always felt that I have a foot at both ends of the spectrum. Hence, in 2023, I finally decided to take that leap of faith and do what I had watched many members of my family do - go independent and create a job position that fits my skills and experiences the most.

## ... and, how is it?
So far, I love being a freelance scientist / independent contractor. I absolutely love being there to support my colleagues when they are in need of expertise and/or extra hands. I totally understand how not fun it is to feel stressed, over-worked, and overloaded with work and to watch a looming deadline come galloping up torward us. I know how that feels and that is why I created a job position for myself that allows me to seamlessly help you in customized and personalized ways.
