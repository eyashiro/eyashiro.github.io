## Who I am and what I do...
I am a scientist with over 20 years of experience in the life sciences research and research support and operations. After a bachelor's degree in neurobiology and behavior and cognitive neuroscience, I started my research career as a wet lab and field scientist in microbial ecology and plant pathology. I gradually transitioned to computational biology and bioinformatics, and now, I exclusively contribute to research projects from the computational and analytical side. Having had over a decade of hands-on wet lab and fieldwork experience allows me to understand biological data both from a biological point of view as well as from a computational point of view. I intuitively understand how sample handling can profoundly affect and bias data. This global understanding of biological data allows me to provide my collaborators with the highest quality results and valuable insights into their data that actually make real-world sense. My experiences also enable me to provide the most optimized recommendations when consulting.

About half of my professional years has also focused on research support and operations. I enjoy helping people succeed and solving complex problems. I first learned about how to support research when I worked for a few years as a laboratory research technician at Cornell University after my undergraduate years. After my postdoctoral work, I learned a great deal about research support and service-oriented working styles while working at ETH's Functional Genomics Center. I continued to hone my service-oriented skills during my years as a staff scientist at Aalborg University. Over the years, I have helped many biologists analyze their data and troubleshoot technical problems with NGS output. In addition to working directly with data, I used to operate an institute's Illumina DNA sequencing facility and made sure that all the scientists got the best output from the samples they trusted me with. I also maintained the same institute's bioinformatics platform in collaboration with system and cloud engineers. I made it my job to ensure that biologists of all levels of computational literacy could learn to use large computational resources to analyze complex data. To achieve this, I helped optimize the computing and data platforms to handle the latest types of NGS data, I built a user-friendly version-controlled bio-software library, and I held regular training sessions to help biologists get initiated into the computing platform.

Research support is not only about operating facilities but also about personalizing the support to cater to individual needs. Hence, I have supported busy scientists and teams by taking over parts of projects and handling various operational tasks, such as negotiating sequencing prices, archiving biological data, and providing content for presentations and research proposals. In 2023, I also completed an editing certificate to provide additional support to scientists who need help with scientific writing and writing in English. Given that each person and team has highly specific needs, I try to widen my breadth of expertise to provide the most personalized level of support. I am also always eager to learn new skills on the job to be better able to help out.

## Why?
I am passionate about science, but having worn many different hats throughout my scientific career, I wanted to find a job where I could use of all of my varied experiences in pure research and research support and operations. Most people are either in pure research or in the service sector, while I have always felt that I have a foot at both ends of the spectrum. Hence, in 2023, I finally decided to take that leap of faith and do what I had watched many members of my family do - go independent and create a job position that fits my skills and experiences the most.

## ... and, how is it?
So far, I love being a freelance scientist / independent contractor. I absolutely love being available to support my colleagues when they need expertise and/or extra hands. I totally understand how not fun it is to feel stressed, overworked, and overloaded with work and to watch a looming deadline come galloping up toward us. I know how that feels, which is why I decided to work in an area that allows me to seamlessly help you in customized and personalized ways.
