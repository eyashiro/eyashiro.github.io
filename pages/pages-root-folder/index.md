  Science  is fascinating at the cutting edge of innovation.</p>
  <p>However, we always have too much to do when we want to move a project forward.</p>

  <p>
  You many be in one of these situations: </p>
  <p>
  &#10132; You don't have enough staff to delegate work to. <br />
  &#10132; Your staff leaves before finishing projects. <br />
  &#10132; You are starting a new project that requires a particular expertise. <br />
  &#10132; You want the maximum impact from your written work. <br />
  &#10132; You are overwhelmed by tasks like submitting sequences to Genbank, polishing user guides, data entry, bio software installations, etc.</p>

  <p>I have over 20 years of experience in the life sciences. Over the last decade, I have been focusing on bioinformatics/computational biology and on providing services to scientists that help improve their productivity and output. Given that my earlier years were spent mostly in the field and the wet lab, I am very good at understanding the link between the data that I analyze and their biology. </p>

  <p><a href="../contact/index.html">Contact me</a> me when you are ready to discuss the specifics of your needs. Also, discuss with me if the services I describe on my website don't quite fit your specific needs.</p>

  <p>I look very much forward to working with you!</p>
