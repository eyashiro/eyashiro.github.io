## Research and Development
I have collaborated on numerous R&D projects, operated an Illumina sequencing facility, and maintained at institute's bioinformatics server platform. Therefore, I have hands-on experience with the entire workflow that many Big Data-related life science research projects go through. I provide my expertise in data analysis, NGS, and bioinformatics while having a thorough understanding of the impact that data collection methodology can have on both the data and the types of analytical approaches we use to pull out insightful information. Check out my research portfolio for my experiences in data analysis and visualization <a href="../portfolio/research/index.html">here</a>.

  </div>
  <div class="medium-4 column">
    <p style="text-align: center">
    <font size="+1.5"><b>Troubleshoot NGS data problems</b></font><br /><br />
    In some cases, your sequencing data does not look right or you are losing more data than you expect from your workflow. I have helped retrieved samples from sequencing projects that lost the barcode-sample matching lists and optimized QC workflows to retrieve more analyzable data.</p>

<a name="Editing"></a>
## Scientific Editing and Proofreading
I have been working with individual colleagues as well as with an academic editing company to support non-native English-speaking scientists and improve their scientific documents, so that they can overcome the language barier, disseminate their research and ideas in high impact journals, and apply to presitigious agencies. In order to provide the best possible services and be able to showcase my expertise in editing, I also successfully completed the <a href="../portfolio/editing/index.html">Poynter ACES Editing Certificate</a> last year. As an editor, I strive for the "4 Cs": clarity, coherence, consisteny, and correctness

Below are the three main things I look out for in your written work:
<br /><br />
<div class="row" id="container">
  <div class="medium-4 column">
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    <font size="+1"><b>Correct Language</b></font><br /><br />
    I will correct the linguistic mistakes that are present in your work. These include checking the grammar, spelling, and level of formality of the language. Awkward sentences will be rewritten, and the flow of the text can be improved. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="medium-4 column">
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    <font size="+1"><b>Check Format and Style</b></font><br /><br />
    If you know where you will be submitting your document to, I can check that the journal or agency house style is respected in your document. I mostly follow the CSE style guide, which is a scientific variant of CMOS. If you have very specific style preferences, I can accommodate your needs. I can edit in American and British English. Any other general formatting issues will also be checked and corrected.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="medium-4 column">
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    <font size="+1"><b>Ensure Consistency</b></font><br /><br />
    Consistency in the use of fonts, punctuation marks, margins, abbreviations, terminology, and style are often overlooked. I will check all of the above to ensure that reading your document becomes a smooth experience for your target readers.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Types of documents
I can work with many types of documents covering the life sciences:
* Reports
* Manuscripts
* Grant proposals
* Abstracts
* Cover letters
* Presentations
* Protocols
* Emails
* and more.

### Levels of editing
I provide two levels of editing, depending on the needs of your document.
  * **Standard Editing:** I will check for linguistic mistakes, formatting and style, consistency, and the flow within sentences.
  * **Substantive Editing:** In addition to everything in Standard Editing, I will also do a more in-depth editing work, including improvements in word usage and sentence structure. I will also check the quality of the flow throughout the manuscript, check for missing information and misplaced information, and point out any scientific issues I encounter.

### Pricing

|   Editing level  |     Price*     |
|------------------|:-------------:|
| Standard editing | 0.06 eur/word |
| Substantive editing | 0.09 eur/word |
| Editing top-up of documents requiring <br />a substantial amount of corrections\*\* | +0.02 eur/word |

\* The price excludes VAT. Businesses within Germany will be charged a 19% VAT. Businesses within the EU will be reverse charge. Businesses outside of the EU will be responsible for their own VAT. Individuals not affiliated with a business will be charged the German 19% VAT.

\*\* The word rate will be determined upon inspection of the document's writing quality. The top-up is to account for the extra time I will need to correct a very poorly written document. It is my experience that most documents are polished enough when handed to me that the top-up is not required.

<script>
    function calculatePrice() {
        const wordCount = document.getElementById('wordCount').value;
        const options = document.getElementsByName('option');
        let pricePerWord = 0;
        for (const option of options) {
            if (option.checked) {
                pricePerWord = parseFloat(option.value);
                break;
            }
        }
        const totalPrice = wordCount * pricePerWord;
        document.getElementById('result').textContent = `Total Price: €${totalPrice.toFixed(2)}`;
    }
